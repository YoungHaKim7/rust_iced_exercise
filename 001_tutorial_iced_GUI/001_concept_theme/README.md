# Key fixes and improvements:

- Added proper struct fields (numbers vector to store pushed integers)

- Fixed the `new()` implementation to properly create a new `Calculator`

- Made methods take `&mut` self since they modify the struct

- Added proper parameters to methods

- Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to enable printing with `dbg!`

- Made my_val mutable in main()

- Fixed enum variant usage (`Message::None` instead of just `None`)

- Removed incorrect `self.push(self)` in `push_int`

- Fixed the add method to actually take a number to add

- The code now compiles and demonstrates basic functionality of pushing numbers and adding values
